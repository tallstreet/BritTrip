###BritTrip
##A project to leverage the limited time you have in a city you don't know.

BritTrip is a one page application built on the Ionic framework, with the help of Angular, Gulp and Sass.

The project was originally created for a hackathon organized by VisitBritain, Yahoo and iGeolise.

To run the app, clone the repo and within the project folder simply type ' node_modules/.bin/ionic serve' to the Terminal.
